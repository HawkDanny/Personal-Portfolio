Each attendee was probably involved in the creation of perhaps a dozen different games, and when the exploration of a game reached a natural conclusion or a lull, we would gather and play a handful of folk games that attendess knew and shared with us.'

However, through the natural rhythm of play and an energetic community of attendees, we arrived somewhere much more similar to a New Games Festival, with a kind of swirling and mutating group of people playing games with increasingly little reservation. It felt like playing outside as kids and I was stunned by how easily that feeling could be created and captured. In my memory Folk Game Game Jam is a beautiful and sunny day.'
