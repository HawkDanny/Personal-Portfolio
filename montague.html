                    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Death of Mr. Montague</span> is a card game designed to foster an environment of bickering, lying, and self-aggrandizing. A silver-tongued player will find themselves at the advantage until their web of lies is unravelled.</p>
                    <p>After the death of an intriguing upscale gentleman by the name of Maximus Montague, all who tenuously knew him in life gather to claim his inheritance. Using your memory of events you shared with Montague, your objective is to convince a third party that you are deserving of his inheritance. However, Montague's perspective is supplied through his will, with dated accounts of events. Roll with the punches, lie to cover up earlier lies, and you will swindle your way into his inheritence.</p>

                <p>Tonight, <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span> accompanied me to one of my favorite gambling houses for a night of diversion. They were hesitant to engage in an "uncouth activity", but I appealed to their better nature.</p>
                <p>While I was holding my own rather well, <span class="redacted">REDACTED</span> quickly exhausted their meager investment. As I am of upstanding moral character, I gave them an extra thousand, and their luck began to turn.</p>
                <p>As the night progressed, more and more people flocked their way, and I ended up at the bar drinking the most ungodly scotch.</p>
