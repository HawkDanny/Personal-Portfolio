            <p><i>The Death of Mr. Montague</i> is an analog game designed to foster an environment of bickering, lying, and self-aggrandizing. After the death of an intriguing upscale gentleman by the name of Maximus Montague, all who knew him in life gather to claim his inheritance. Calling upon even the most tenuous of connections to Montague, a silver tongued player finds themselves at an advantage when it is revealed that Montague's will mentions no names, but merely characteristics.</p>

            <h4>Leave room for narrative extrapolation. Give the player enough breadcrumbs, and eventually they'll figure out something on their own.</h4><br>
            <h4>Montague presents its narrative as discrete nodes, rooted in a timeline. The players weave these nodes together, and create a unique story each playthrough.</h4>
            <!--<p>The most powerful narrative tool is an imagination. A great narrative is one that limits shrinking of the possibility space. If the goal of a story is to create a very rich world, the focus should not be on explicitly defining aspects of the world, but on definings spaces within the world, and providing a structure for a consumer's brain to populate that space.</p>-->
